//   this     file  is  for  testing   documents  and   therefore  the   developers   should    implement  the    documents  logics   here   ,  the   types   of  documents   to  be   
//   implemented  are  the   following:  student  documents,  teacher  documents,  and   school  documents.  The   developers   should    implement  the    logic   for   each   type   of
//   document  and   ensure  that   the   documents  are  stored  in  the   database.  The   developers   should    also  implement  the   logic   for   retrieving,
//   updating,  and   deleting  documents.  The   developers   should    also   implement  the   logic   for   searching  documents  by  type,  date,  and   other
//   criteria.  The   developers   should    also  implement  the   logic   for   pagination  and   sorting  of  documents.     
//   The   developers   should    also  implement  the   logic   for   handling  errors  and   exceptions.  The   developers   should    also  implement  the
//   logic   for   logging  and   monitoring  of  documents.  The   developers   should    also  implement  the   logic   for   security  and   access
//   control  of  documents.  The   developers   should    also  implement  the   logic   for   auditing  and   compliance  of  documents.  The   developers   should    also
//   implement  the   logic   for   archiving  and   retention  of          documents.  The   developers   should    also  implement  the   logic   for   versioning
//   of  documents.  The   developers   should    also  implement  the   logic   for   notifications  and   alerts  of  documents.  The   developers   should    also
//   implement  the   logic   for   integration  with  other  systems  and   services.  The   developers   should    also  implement  the   logic   for   reporting
//   and   analytics  of  documents.  The   developers   should    also  implement  the   logic   for   backups  and   disaster  recovery  of
//   documents.  The   developers   should    also  implement  the   logic   for   versioning  of  documents.  The   developers   should    also  implement  the
//   logic   for   sharing  and   collaboration  of  documents.  The   developers   should    also  implement  the   logic   for   notifications
//   and   alerts  of  documents.  The   developers   should    also  implement  the   logic   for   integration  with  other  systems  and   services.
